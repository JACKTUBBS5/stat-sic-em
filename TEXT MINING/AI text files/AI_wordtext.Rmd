## This data was created using chatGPT 3.5

The dialog was as follows:
$$\begin{itemize}
\item Provide 25 short sentences describing the advantages of using AI bots
\item Repeat the above listing the dangers of using AI bots
\item Provide the r code for producing a word cloud with each list
\end{itemize}$$
```{r}
