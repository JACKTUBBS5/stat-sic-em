I have listed a selection of possible projects for STAT 4382 teams' projects. Each project has the data in a .csv format. 
I have also provided SAS code for possible ways in which I would analyze the data. You can use my SAS code as a guide for 
creating your teams RStudio code and results. As each data set has a story (background, problem of interest, your approach, 
and your results) you should include these in your final report.

The projects include:
    Binge Drinking in US 2003 - 2021 for male and females ages 18-25.
    Heart Failure in the Framingham MA cohort study
    Analysis for taste quality for Red Wines.
    Diabetes data for Pima Indian study.
    Prostrate Cancer Study.
    Health concerns in US Law Enforcement Officers (LEO).

This is a team project, so each member of the team will contribute to the final report. Some of the material that your report
should include is NOT STATISTICAL. The hard part is communication of your story. The WHY, the WHAT, the SO WHAT, 
and the NOW WHAT are much more important than the HOW!

Each of the above projects, except for the binge drinking will make use of some elementary machine learning techniques, 
CART and Random Forest. The binge drinking problem will involve modeling data collected over time. Probably more matheatical 
than statistical.
