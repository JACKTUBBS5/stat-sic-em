About Dataset
Context
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, 
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed 
on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are 
females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

Content
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. 
Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

Can you build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in 
the dataset have diabetes or not?

DESCRIPTION
Predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures.

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
Inspiration:

some values are not in the range where they are supposed to be, should be treated as missing value.
What kind of method is better to use to fill this type of missing value? How further clasification will be like?
Is there any sub-groups significantly more likely to have diabetes?
