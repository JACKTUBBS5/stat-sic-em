The files in this folder originated in a collection of case studies using JMP. The file entitled
jmp003-defect-sampling.pdf has instruction and background material for analyzing the data using JMP. The
data is in a JMP format which I have converted to a xlsx and csv file. You can use the csv file for getting
the data into RStudio and Sas OnDemand.

Problem 1
  Reproduce the JMP analysis using R and SAS.  The original problem was to illustrate different sampling
  strategies in terms of the frequency of inspected parts. 

I have added the following for which I will consider some simple inference procedures.

Problem 2
  Are there differences in defects as a function of the time of day? Break the day into 4 parts - id 1-8, 9-16, 
  17 - 24, 25 - 32. Redo the graphics and descriptive statistics to illustrate how the number of defects is 
  influenced by the time of day--early, mid morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon.
Problem 3
  Are there differences in defects as a function of the time of week? Break the week into 2 parts - days 1,2,6,7 and 
  days 4,5,9,10. Redo the graphics and descriptive statistics to illustrate how the number of defects is influenced by
  the day of the week; early,and late.

This is a teams project. Since most members have experience with R, do each problem with R. Then repeat the analysis using SAS Studio.
How do you get the SAS code, wait for Tubbs!  Long wait, I'm not doing this problem! Use the tasks section (with videos assistance) in 
SAS Studio to write the SAS code for the graphics and descriptive procedures you need. In essence, you are teaching yourself 
SAS (I'll help!) or Use an AIBot to convert your R code to SAS and then make the SAS work (I'll watch!)
